Installation
============

Glue only depends on one external library, `PIL <http://www.pythonware.com/products/pil/>`_.
``PIL`` is a graphic library for python and it's used to create the sprites images.

You will also need ``Python 2.5`` or higher to get started, so be sure to have an up to date ``Python 2.x`` installation.

System Wide Installation
------------------------
Just run ``easy_install`` with root rights::

    $ sudo easy_install glue

`(Run it in an Admin shell on Windows systems and without sudo).`

or even better using ``pip``::

    $ pip install glue

Development version
-------------------

The source code of Glue is available on Github `https://github.com/jorgebastida/glue/ <https://github.com/jorgebastida/glue/>`_.
